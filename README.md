Task 1: Simple Process Scheduling Algorithm
Implemented a CPU process scheduling algorithm using a circular linked list where each node represents a process with attributes: process_id, execution_time, and remaining_time. 
The scheduler should cycle through processes, assign a fixed CPU time per cycle, update their remaining time, and remove completed processes while displaying the state after each cycle, 
including the handling of new process arrivals.

Task 2: Very Large Prime Number Calculation
Stored a 1024-bit random number in a linked list, with each node containing up to 64-bit integers. 
Implemented a method to check the primality of the entire number across multiple nodes, and output whether the number is prime or not.
